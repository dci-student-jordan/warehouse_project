# warehouse_project
This is a work in progress project for the python-backend-developer course I'm currently making at the [DCI](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/).
There is nothing to order, it is just for practicing purpose.
It aims to become a fully functional prototype web application for a Warehouse Management System.

Features planned so far ar:
- A user system with roles and permissions for listing and placing orders.
- Maintain the stock of a warehouse.
- Order items from the warehouse.
- Log actions from users.
- Reporting.

This project is published under the [MIT-Licence](https://github.com/dci-student-jordan/warehouse_project/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)
